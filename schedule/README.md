# Workshop Schedule

> **NOTE:** The *Basic Data Skills* [Introduction to R](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/) workshop is a prerequisite. If you would like some practice wih R prior to taking this workshop, please work through this [R refresher lesson](https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop_salmon_online/lessons/R_refresher.html).


## Pre-reading:

* Please **study the contents** and **work through all the exercises** within the following lessons:
  * [Workflow overview: From sequenced reads to peaks](../lessons/00a_peak_calling_workflow_review.md)
  * [Existing workflows for ChIP-seq analysis](../lessons/00b_peak_calling_with_nfcore.md)
  * Download the compressed R Project that we will be using by right-clicking on [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/s9mxwd7ttqgjt040m6bm2/Peak_analysis.zip?rlkey=ceqbv4pyx59jxsoa0xoh9l6kb&st=q7rlclil&dl=1) and selecting **"Save Link As..."** and download the compressed R Project to your desired location. Double-click on the compressed ZIP file in order to uncompress it.

### Before the next class:

I. Please **study the contents** and **work through all the code** within the following lessons:
   1. [Assessing sample similarity and identifying potential outliers](../lessons/02b_sample_similarity.md)
      <details>
       <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
         <br>One step in the QC of samples is to see how samples compare to one another. Generally, we expect replicates from each sample group to be more similar to each other and dissimilar to replicates from a different sample group. Here, we use read density (counts across the genome) and peak signal data to check if it meets our expectations.<br><br>In this lesson you will:<br>
             - Create PCA plots and inter-sample correlation heatmaps<br>
             - Evaluat plots to identify potential outliers and other effects<br>
             - Create visualiations using signal data from peaks to identify proposed thresholds for downstream analysis<br><br>
        </details>
   

   2. [Concordance across replicates using peak overlaps](../lessons/03_peak_overlaps.md)
      <details>
       <summary><i>Click here for a preview of this lesson</i></summary>
         <br>A two sentence summary of the lesson.... <br><br>In this lesson, we will:<br>
             - Point 1<br>
             - Point 2<br><br>
        </details>
        

3. **Complete the exercises**:
